     *                        (e.g. "GSSAPI", "DIGEST-MD5").
     * @param authorizationID The possibly null protocol-dependent
     *                        identification to be used for authorization. If 
     *                        null or empty, the server derives an authorization
     *                        ID from the client's authentication credentials.

     *                        the authentication is being performed, e.g "ldap".

     * @param props           The possibly null set of properties used to select

     *                        authentication exchange of the selected mechanism.

     *                        is requested by using a RealmChoiceCallback if 
     *                        there is a list of realms to choose from, and by
     *                        using a RealmCallback if the realm must be enterd.
