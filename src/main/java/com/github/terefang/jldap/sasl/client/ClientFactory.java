     *                    the IANA-registered name of a SASL mechanism (e.g. "GSSAPI", "CRAM-MD5")
     *
     * @param authorizationId  The possibly null protocol-dependent
     *                     identification to be used for authorization. If
     *                     null or empty, the server derives an authorization
     *                     ID from the client's authentication credentials.
     *                     When the SASL authentication completes
     *                     successfully, the specified entity is granted
     *                     access.
     *
     * @param protocol     The non-null string name of the protocol for which
     *                     the authentication is being performed (e.g. "ldap")
     *
     * @param serverName   The non-null fully qualified host name of the server
     *                     to authenticate to
     *
     * @param props        The possibly null set of properties used to select

     *                     authentication exchange of the selected mechanism.

     *                     mechanism are ignored.

     *                     application/library to complete the authentication.

     *                     authentication ID, password and realm from the
     *                     caller. The authentication ID is requested by using

     *                     a PasswordCallback. The realm is requested by using
     *                     a RealmChoiceCallback if there is a list of realms
     *                     to choose from, and by using a RealmCallback if the
     *                     realm must be entered.
